### Comprehensive Technical Analysis Report for NVDA (as of 2026-02-13)

---

#### **Executive Summary**
NVDA is currently trading in a **consolidation phase** following a strong rally from late December 2025 to early February 2026. The stock has retraced significantly from its peak near $193.61 on February 12, dropping to $186.94 on February 12 and closing near that level. Technical indicators suggest **mixed but stabilizing momentum**, with volatility increasing and short-term overbought conditions easing. Key support/resistance levels and divergences across multiple indicators point toward a potential **resumption of the prior uptrend** if $185–$186 zone holds.

---

#### **Price Action Overview (Last 3 Months)**

- **Trend**: NVDA moved from ~$187 in mid-November 2025 to a high of $193.61 on February 12, then pulled back sharply on February 12–13, closing at $186.94.
- **Volume Surge**: Noticeable spike on February 12 (189.9M shares) coinciding with the price rejection from $193.61, indicating distribution or profit-taking.

---

#### **Trend Indicators**

##### **10 EMA vs. 50 SMA (Short- vs Medium-Term Trend)**
- As of 2026-02-13:
  - **10 EMA**: $185.41
  - **50 SMA**: $184.41
- The 10 EMA has been *above* the 50 SMA since late January, confirming a short-term uptrend.
- On February 12–13, the 10 EMA crossed *below* the 50 SMA temporarily (185.99 vs 184.38 on Feb 12), but on Feb 13 it re-crossed back above (185.41 > 184.41). This suggests **resilience near support** and potential short-term bottoming.

##### **Interpretation**
- The recent crossover and re-cross are typical in a healthy uptrend correction—**not a trend reversal**, but a consolidation signal.
- The 50 SMA has flattened (~$184.4), indicating the medium-term trend is stabilizing after a downtrend from late December.

---

#### **Momentum Indicators**

##### **MACD Line & Signal (macd, macds)**
- **MACD Line**: +0.109 on Feb 13 (up from -1.476 on Feb 5)
- **MACD Signal**: +0.028 on Feb 13 (up from +0.144 on Feb 5)
- The MACD line was in negative territory from January 20 to February 5, indicating bearish momentum.
- A sharp recovery began on February 6, crossing above the signal line on February 13—**a bullish crossover**.
- However, the MACD histogram is still low (0.081), suggesting momentum is **rebuilding but not yet strong**.

##### **MACD Histogram (macdh)**
- Peaked at ~+1.6 in late December 2025 and early January 2026.
- Dropped to -1.62 on February 5 (oversold momentum).
- Now at +0.08, indicating a **reversal in momentum direction**, but still below historical levels.

##### **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
- RSI = **47.33** on Feb 13 (down from 55.16 on Feb 11).
- RSI was in the oversold zone (~34) on February 5, then rose steadily.
- The current level is neutral—**no overbought/oversold pressure**, allowing room for upward movement.

##### **Momentum Summary**
- Momentum has bottomed and is recovering. The MACD crossover + rising RSI from oversold zone suggest **short-term bullish reversal potential**, but momentum strength (as seen in histogram) remains below prior highs.

---

#### **Volatility & Bollinger Bands**

##### **Bollinger Bands**
- **Upper Band**: $196.47
- **Middle Band (50 SMA)**: $184.41
- **Lower Band**: $174.14

##### **Price vs. Bands**
- Price closed at $186.94 on Feb 13, which is:
  - **Below the middle band** ($184.41) → technically in the upper half of the Bollinger Band range.
  - Far from the upper band ($196.47), offering ~$10 upside before resistance.
  - Well above the lower band ($174.14), indicating no immediate oversold bounce pressure.

##### **Volatility (ATR)**
- ATR = $6.41 on Feb 13, up from ~$5.2 in mid-January.
- Increasing volatility aligns with recent price swings and volume surges—**higher risk/reward environment**.

##### **Bollinger Interpretation**
- Price near the middle band with expanding volatility suggests a **breakout setup** is forming. A close above $188–$190 would likely trigger an uptrend resumption toward $195+.
- The lower band is now ~$174, offering strong support—if broken, it could signal deeper correction.

---

#### **Volume Analysis (VWMA)**

##### **VWMA vs. Price**
- VWMA = $185.35 on Feb 13
- Price = $186.94 → price is **above VWMA**, indicating buying pressure.
- VWMA has been rising since early February after bottoming near $180 in late January—**volume confirms uptrend resilience**.

##### **Volume Confirmation**
- On February 6, a sharp rally (+$13.5) occurred on high volume (231M), confirming the bottom.
- February 12’s rejection at $193 with high volume suggests distribution but also strong resistance—typical of a **healthy pullback** before continuation.

---

#### **Synthesis & Key Observations**

| **Aspect** | **Observation** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Trend** | Short-term uptrend intact (10 EMA > 50 SMA); medium-term trend neutralizing near $184–$186. |
| **Momentum** | MACD bullish crossover + RSI rebound from oversold = momentum reversal in progress. |
| **Volatility** | ATR rising; price in upper half of Bollinger Band range—breakout likely. |
| **Volume** | VWMA > price, confirming buying pressure; volume supported the February 6 bottom and February 12 rejection. |
| **Key Levels** | - Support: $185–$186 (10 EMA & VWMA), $174 (lower Bollinger Band).<br>- Resistance: $190–$193 (recent highs), $196.5 (upper band). |

---

#### **Trade Implications**

- **Bullish Scenario**: A close above $190 (especially on volume > 180M) would confirm resumption of uptrend toward $195–$196. Stop-loss: below $184.5.
- **Bearish Scenario**: A break below $174 (lower Bollinger Band) would invalidate the short-term uptrend and suggest deeper correction to $165–$170.
- **Neutral/Range-Bound Strategy**: Trade between $174–$193 with tight stops. Buy near $185–$186 on support, sell near $192–$193.

---

#### **Final Recommendation**

**BUY/HOLD/SELL**: **HOLD** for now. The technical setup is favorable for a bounce, but momentum is still rebuilding. Wait for confirmation (e.g., close above $190 with volume > 180M) before increasing exposure.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The tool continues to return irrelevant Rivian news instead of NVIDIA (NVDA)-related updates. Given the repeated failures to retrieve correct NVDA news, I’ll need to proceed with analysis based on known information up to my knowledge cutoff and infer likely developments for the week of February 6–13, 2026 — though this is suboptimal.

However, since my role is strictly tool-dependent and I must rely on the `get_news` tool for accurate and timely insights, I should inform you that the tool appears malfunctioning or misconfigured for NVDA queries.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**  
Rationale: Without reliable recent news or sentiment data for NVIDIA (NVDA) for the week of February 6–13, 2026, any trading recommendation would be speculative. The repeated retrieval of unrelated Rivian news suggests a technical issue with the tool or data source. A hold is prudent until verified data becomes available.

To proceed, I recommend manually verifying recent NVIDIA developments—especially around AI chip demand, earnings outlooks (Q4 FY2026 may be approaching), partnerships, or supply chain updates—and monitoring for any regulatory news (e.g., export controls on H100/A100 alternatives). If you can provide direct links or excerpts from credible sources (e.g., NVIDIA investor relations, TechCrunch, Bloomberg), I can re-analyze with high confidence.

Let me know if you'd like to retry the query with a modified format or explore alternative approaches.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

The provided news data reveals limited specific coverage for **NVIDIA (NVDA)** over the past week (Feb 6–13, 2026), with only one indirect mention in a broader market context — a report about **Rivian's surge** driven by delivery guidance and R2 vehicle launch plans. While Rivian is not NVDA, the article may be relevant if there are ecosystem connections (e.g., AI-driven autonomous driving tech), but no explicit link is stated.

### Key Observations:

- **NVDA-specific news**: No direct headlines or press releases concerning NVIDIA were retrieved in the past week. This could indicate either a quiet news cycle for the company, or potential focus on broader market trends (e.g., IPOs, energy sector volatility) overshadowing tech stocks.
  
- **Global macro highlights**:
  - **IPO activity** is robust — SOLV Energy (MWH) saw a 22.68% surge post-IPO, and Arko Petroleum priced a $200M offering. These suggest continued appetite for new listings in energy and possibly adjacent sectors.
  - **Energy sector volatility**: Multiple reports indicate energy stocks swung between gains and losses midweek — reflecting oil price sensitivity or macro uncertainty (e.g., inflation, Fed policy).
  - **U.S. jobs report impact**: A Barrons piece suggests the recent jobs data provided a modest boost to market sentiment, potentially supporting risk assets like tech.
  - **Chinese tech renewed interest**: A Barrons article highlights Chinese tech stocks as an emerging opportunity — could signal macro rotation or diversification interest that might eventually spill over into U.S.-listed AI/semiconductor names.

### Implications for NVDA:

- While no direct news, NVIDIA remains a bellwether for AI and semiconductor demand. With no earnings or product announcements reported recently, the market may be in a **pause/consolidation phase**, awaiting next catalyst (e.g., Q1 earnings, new chip launch, or macro data).
  
- The broader tech sentiment appears cautiously positive: strong IPOs + modest job data boost = supportive backdrop *if* NVDA resumes growth momentum.

- Energy sector volatility may reflect shifting capital flows — if investors rotate back into growth/tech, NVDA could be a beneficiary.

### Summary Table

| Category | Key Development | Relevance to NVDA / Trading |
|---------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **NVDA News** | No direct headlines in past week | Neutral — possible lull before catalysts |
| **Rivian Surge** | +20% on R2 launch guidance | Indirect — may signal renewed EV/AI hardware interest |
| **IPO Activity** | SOLV Energy +22.68% post-IPO; Arko $200M offering | Moderate — indicates risk-on sentiment, supports tech multiples |
| **Energy Sector Volatility** | Multiple “higher/lower” afternoon updates | Low — reflects commodity swings, possible sector rotation signal |
| **U.S. Jobs Report** | "Good news" boost for market | Mildly positive — supports continued risk appetite |
| **Chinese Tech Focus** | Barrons article highlights 7 names | Potential long-term tailwind if global AI race expands |

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**  
— Given lack of NVDA-specific news and a mixed but not strongly negative macro backdrop, holding is appropriate while awaiting next catalyst (e.g., earnings, AI demand update). A breakout above recent highs could trigger buy signal.
