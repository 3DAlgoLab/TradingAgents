# Intention

- This codebase is made with LangGraph for the implemenation of agents. 
- But this framework seems too verbose. 
- I prefer DSPy for its compactness and opening optimizable way to prompting. 

## Mission 1: Planning for migrating to DSPy
- Analyze `tardingagents` lang-graph implementation. 
- You can look up dspy example codes, `./ref/dspy-grok`
- Write a step by step plan document in `./experiments` folder for this migration
